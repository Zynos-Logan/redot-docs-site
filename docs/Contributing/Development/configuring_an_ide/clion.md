# CLion

[CLion ](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) is a commercial
[JetBrains ](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDE for C++.

## Importing the project

CLion can import a project's [compilation database file ](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html), commonly named ``compile_commands.json``. To generate the compilation database file, open the terminal, change to the Godot root directory, and run:

```
scons compiledb=yes

```

Then, open the Godot root directory with CLion. CLion will import the compilation database, index the codebase, and provide autocompletion and other advanced code navigation and refactoring functionality.

## Compiling and debugging the project

CLion does not support compiling and debugging Godot via SCons out of the box. This can be achieved by creating a custom build target and run configuration in CLion. Before creating a custom build target, you must [compile Godot ](toc-devel-compiling) once on the command line, to generate the Godot executable. Open the terminal, change into the Godot root directory, and execute:

```
scons dev_build=yes

```

To add a custom build target that invokes SCons for compilation:

- Open CLion and navigate to **Preferences &gt; Build, Execution, Deployment &gt; Custom Build Targets**

- Click **Add target** and give the target a name, e.g. ``Godot debug``.

- Click **...** next to the **Build:** selectbox, then click the **+** button in the **External Tools** dialog to add a new external tool.

- Give the tool a name, e.g. ``Build Godot debug``, set **Program** to ``scons``, set **Arguments** to the compilation settings you want (see [compiling Godot ](toc-devel-compiling)), and set the **Working directory** to ``$ProjectFileDir$``, which equals the Godot root directory. Click **OK** to create the tool.

:::note
CLion does not expand shell commands like ``scons -j$(nproc)``. Use concrete values instead, e.g. ``scons -j8``.

- Back in the **External Tools** dialog, click the **+** again to add a second external tool for cleaning the Godot build via SCons. Give the tool a name, e.g. ``Clean Godot debug``, set **Program** to ``scons``, set **Arguments** to ``-c`` (which will clean the build), and set the **Working directory** to ``$ProjectFileDir$``. Click **OK** to create the tool.

- Close the **External Tools** dialog. In the **Custom Build Target** dialog for the custom ``Godot debug`` build target, select the **Build Godot debug** tool from the **Build** select box, and select the **Clean Godot debug** tool from the **Clean** select box. Click **OK** to create the custom build target.

- In the main IDE window, click **Add Configuration**.

- In the **Run/Debug Configuration** dialog, click **Add new...**, then select **Custom Build Application** to create a new custom run/debug configuration.

- Give the run/debug configuration a name, e.g. ``Godot debug``, select the ``Godot debug`` custom build target as the **Target**. Select the Godot executable in the ``bin/`` folder as the **Executable**, and set the **Program arguments** to ``--editor --path path-to-your-project/``, where ``path-to-your-project/`` should be a path pointing to an existing Godot project. If you omit the ``--path`` argument, you will only be able to debug the Godot Project Manager window. Click **OK** to create the run/debug configuration.

You can now build, run, debug, profile, and Valgrind check the Godot editor via the run configuration.

When playing a scene, the Godot editor will spawn a separate process. You can debug this process in CLion by going to **Run &gt; Attach to process...**, typing ``godot``, and selecting the Godot process with the highest **pid** (process ID), which will usually be the running project.
